# OR Case 2
## Description
This is the second group case of the course Operations Research, Spring 2022.
In this case, we try to design and create a heuristic algorithm for a previously studied job shop problem.
We then create our own instances, experiment our heuristic algorithm on them and compare the result to 2 other heuristic algorithm we chose as benchmark.
